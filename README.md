# Custom Platform Manager

*Custom Platform Manager* is a mod for Gorilla Tag (A popular VR game available on Steam and Oculus). It allows the player to summon a platform by pressing grip (left or right hand) which allows the player to move in air. In stump there should be a menu that allows you to change the Color, Shape, and Size of the platform. Because the mod is only available to use in modded lobbies, I'm 99.9% sure this mod is safe to use without getting banned.
